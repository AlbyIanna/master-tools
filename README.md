This is an archive of characters and other stuff for D&amp;D 3.5 masters and eventually players.

The idea is to collect a lot of characters, maps, events and other things; in this way the Master can easily create new encunters and manage sessions.

Next step is to automate generation of NPCs and events based on the data in the archive.
